## Antec Flux Pro Display Service
A small, lightweight app that runs in the background that gets system cpu and gpu temperature using libre hardware monitor's library. Data is displayed directly to your Antec Flux Pro display on the side of the case. 

## Notes
To build and export the project locally, I run this
`dotnet publish -c Release -p:SelfContained=false`
